#### Task:
In this competition, a multiple product review sentiment classification model needs to be built. There are ~150k product reviews from different categories, including electronics, furniture, home & living products like air-conditioner and fashion products like T-shirts, rings, etc. For data security purposes, the review ids will be desensitized. The evaluation metrics is top-1 accuracy.

#### Reflection:
This is my first attempt at solving a NLP Classification Challenge. I have only started exploring NLP after enrolling into NLP courses at DataCamp. Key takeaway from this competition is that messy textual data can really affect the performance of the classification model built. Hence, it's always important to conduct textual analysis and use the insights obtained to modify/improve the cleaning processes.
